## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Justin Fuller.

I'm a Staff Software Engineer at [The New York Times](https://open.nytimes.com).

### At The Times

I architected and built (along with many others!) features like Subscriber Gift Articles.

Our Gift Subscription Feature.

And most recently, I'm rearchitecting the systems that power the messages we show on our paywall and other spaces across Web and Mobile.

### On my own

I like to build projects in my free time that make my life better.

#### Purchase Plan

I built [purchaseplan.io](https://www.purchaseplan.io) to help my wife and I plan our purchases.

#### Really Simple Notes

I built [reallysimplenotes.com](https://www.reallysimplenotes.com) to help me remain focused and write better notes.

#### Better Interviews

And I'm currently building [Better Interviews](https://interviews.justindfuller.com) to reduce bias in the interviews I conduct.

### Writing

I also write about life.
